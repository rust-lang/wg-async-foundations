# Major unresolved questions or controveries

This section contains places where there remains significant design work to be done.
It also contains some points of major controversy, where the path is clear, but many
people disagree on whether to take it. These are places where further input can be useful.

The page for each controversy attempts to summarize the various options available and some of
the tradeoffs involved.
